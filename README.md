# Silkworm

Silkworm is a WordPress plugin update ticket creation tool. It's meant to bridge the gap between [Platypus](https://github.com/farghul/platypus.git) and [Bowerbird](https://github.com/farghul/bowerbird.git), reading the output from *Platypus* and supplying *Bowerbird* with information recieved and tickets created.

## 📚 Prerequisite

The [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev "Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go") installed to enable building executables from source code.

A variety of json files to enable ticket creation, authorized querying, and changelog gathering (see `jsons` folder for reference).

## 🚧 Build

Before building the application, change the values of these constants to reflect your environment:

``` go
temp     string = "/data/automation/temp/"
tokens   string = "/data/automation/tokens/"
repos    string = "/data/automation/checkouts/"
config   string = "desso-automation-conf/atlassian/"
```

Then, from the root folder containing `main.go`, use the command that matches your environment:

### Windows & Mac

``` zsh
go build -o [name] .
```

### Linux

``` zsh
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o [name] .
```

## 🏃 Run

``` zsh
silkworm -r
```
